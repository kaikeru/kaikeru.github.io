<p>This is hard for me to admit, but I&rsquo;ve failed at hitting the same goal every year for the last 10 years. I want to pass the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese-Language_Proficiency_Test">Japanese Language Proficiency Test</a> (JLPT). The test is broken into levels N5 -&gt; N1. Each level tests your reading and listening skills. N5 is basic Japanese where N1 is hard enough to make fluent speakers second guess their education.</p>

<p>The test is a bureaucratic take on Japanese language and your mastery over it. I&rsquo;m added the &ldquo;bureaucratic&rdquo; nature of the test for two reasons. First, Japanese love certifications and most jobs require you pass the JLPT at the N2 level before they would even give you a stern look. Second, the test does little to show you are able to communicate in the every day. Nothing about speaking or writing is on this test. I have seen firsthand some Japanese language scholars passing the N1 who couldn&rsquo;t hold a conversation if their dignity depended on it. That being said, if one is able to pass the N2 or N1 tests, you probably are pretty good at Japanese.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-to-the-n4">The Road to the N4</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve studied Japanese off and on for close to 12 years. I can stumble through Japan and come out relatively unbruised. Sure, I&rsquo;ve had a few mishaps in communication which led to some awkward moments that led to walking a few hours across Kyoto. What bothers me is that I&rsquo;ve lost a lot of my skills in 12 years. My language proficiency chart looks like a stock ticker that peaked in 2010 but bad management and unfocused direction caused investors to lose confidence.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to take the reigns again and shoot for a concrete goal. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> goal. Since I need more management in my life, I&rsquo;m making this goal in a way that I will be held accountable.</p>

<p><strong>SMART</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><em>Specific</em> - Pass the JLPT N4.</li>
<li><em>Measurable</em> - Did I get a the certificate.</li>
<li><em>Assignable</em> - Me, I&rsquo;m doing this.</li>
<li><em>Realistic</em> - Test is the first Sunday of December which gives 10 months of study.</li>
<li><em>Time Related</em> - See above.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that&rsquo;s the goal. I will pass the JLPT N4. My motivation is less I want the certificate but this will be a flag on my journey. I love Japan and Japanese culture so becoming fluent is a huge motivator for me. I want to read texts I can&rsquo;t find in English. I want to learn more. Fluency is such a long ways off that it&rsquo;s demoralizing. Putting in rest stops like the N4 lets me have those wins that keep my caveman brain going.</p>

<h2 id="the-study-tools">The Study Tools</h2>

<p>After researching online, as one does in this day and age, I put together the tools to accompany me on this long road. They all augment what I need to prepare for: grammar, vocab, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji">kanji</a>. Luckily, I&rsquo;m still proficient at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana">kana</a> and don&rsquo;t need to start completely from scratch.</p>

<p><strong>Main Tools</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span lang="ja-jp"><a href="https://shop.whiterabbitjapan.com/pages/minna-no-nihongo">みんなの日本語</a> - 初級 1 &amp; 2</span> - Japanese Grammar, vocab, and reading using all the books and workbooks.</li>
<li>Anki - To reenforce the <span lang="ja-jp">みんなの日本語</span> vocab.</li>
<li>WaniKani - A kanji learning tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.japanesepod101.com/">JapanesePod101</a> - A great way to practice listening.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Supplementary Tools</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Basic-Japanese-Grammar/dp/4789004546"><em>A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar</em></a> - <em>The</em> Japanese grammar reference.</li>
<li><a href="https://jisho.org/">jisho.org</a> - Honestly, I don&rsquo;t need a physical dictionary.</li>
<li><a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%88%E3%81%A4%E3%81%B0%E3%81%A8!">よつばと!</a> - Because its a fun manga to read.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-not-genki">Why Not <em>Genki</em>?</h3>

<p>The only contentious tool listed above is the textbook, <span lang="ja-jp">みんなの日本語</span>. In English speaking countries, the gold standard beginner&rsquo;s Japanese textbook (especially for self study) is the wonderful <a href="https://shop.whiterabbitjapan.com/pages/genki"><em>Genki</em></a> series. I&rsquo;ve used it in that past, and I loved it. So why not use <em>Genki</em>?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t own a copy of <em>Genki</em>. I own all the books for <span lang="ja-jp">みんなの日本語</span>.</p>

<p>They are both great textbooks and both will get you to N4 if you study their beginners series. The only real difference is the order of presented content.</p>

<p>A word for those who found this post looking for study tips. If you are unsure about which series to go with, I&rsquo;d go with <em>Genki</em>. It&rsquo;s cheaper and much easier to find outside of Japan. The only reason I own <span lang="ja-jp">みんなの日本語</span> is I purchased my copy in Japan. <a href="https://shop.whiterabbitjapan.com/pages/minna-no-nihongo">It is easier to find now a days, though.</a></p>

<h2 id="the-study-plan">The Study Plan</h2>

<p>The plan is all the following before the date of the next JLPT in December:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finish 50 <span lang="ja-jp">みんなの日本語</span> lessons.</li>
<li>Learn all Anki flash cards from the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1847451780">Minna No Nihongo deck</a>.</li>
<li>Reach level 27 in Wanikani (Found this <a href="https://www.wkstats.com/#charts.jlpt">handy chart</a> that roughly shows the JLPT kanji in relation to Wanikani levels.)</li>
<li>Take at least two JLPT N5 practice tests.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>weekly goals</em> break down:</p>

<ul>
<li>One lesson in <span lang="ja-jp">みんなの日本語</span>.

<ul>
<li>All grammar points.</li>
<li>All workbook practices.</li>
<li>All reading practices.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Master 20 vocab a week.</li>
<li>Master 5 kanji a week.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this seems doable even though I work full time and have a life outside of Japanese. Remember, SMART.</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>

<p>Will I accomplish it? I hope so. As I stared with, I&rsquo;m 10 years over overdue for this goal. Let&rsquo;s see if I post about triumph or failure in December. I&rsquo;ll set a reminder.</p>
